# snake_demo

Having some fun with Python and Pygame, this code creates a classic snake game. It utilizes the Pygame library to render graphics and manage game logic. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat the food (displayed as an image). The snake grows longer each time it eats, and the objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The score is displayed at the bottom, and the game resets if the snake hits a wall or itself. The arrow keys control the snake's direction. It's a nostalgic and entertaining gaming experience.
